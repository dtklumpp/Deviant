    <!-- all a-tags on hover should show an image popup/preview of the listed vocabulary: ie: Phantom Wars= cities in destruction, Federate Domain: big brother, Rebels: coalition -->
<p>Even since the <a href="#" >Phantom Wars</a> the <a href="#">Federate Domain</a> has occupied and controlled nations.<br/>   
There are still subverts among us, whose life priority is to overthrow the Federate Domain by transporting <a href="">packages</a>
containing extremely classified and sensitive data between its rebel hubs<br/>
Technology is monitored like never before, rebels can’t use it to communicate but they are trained to be skilled decoders.</p>

<p>Rebels daily navigate the streets of a post-apocalyptic city flooded with evil-doers, spies, and <a href="">bot-cops</a> who are rigorously <b>verifying identities</b> to winnow out the deviant forces that plot against the Federate Domain.</p>

<p>Every time a rebel (the user) comes across a police-bot they must do an identity check.<br/>
Only the <a href="">“approved citizens”</a> are given the correct hourly code<a href="">(encryption)</a> sent to their identity transmitters.<br/>
The rebels have been at work to crack these codes ever since they’ve been enforced. <br/>
The bot-cops will link their <a href="">id-checker</a> to your <a href="">id-transmitter.</a> When they do, they don't know the difference between an "approved citizen's" trasmitter spewing out correct lines of code or if the code is simply just being typed out quickly.<br/>
This is as some would say <a href="">'pulling the wool over the sheeps eyes'</a>, or the "rebel's" small window of opportunity to pass off as an "approved citizen".<br/>
A field-rebel must be able to input the correct code at a speed comprable to the bot-cops id-checker, so quickly. <br/>
The more codes someone can produce the more likely they have the real code and are an “approved citizen”</p>

<p>First let's give you some training to ready you for the field.<br/>
Can you decode the encrypted equation, and produce the code in time?
